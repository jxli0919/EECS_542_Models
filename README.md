# EECS542_Practice

This is practice code for interesting models mentioned in [EECS 542: Advanced Topics in Computer Vision](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~ahowens/eecs542/w24/). They include diffusion model, transformer, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF).

   As UNet is the backbone of the Stable Diffusion model, I tried to implement it from scratch.
