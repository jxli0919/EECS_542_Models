# EECS542_Models

This is repository for coding some interesting models mentioned in [EECS 542: Advanced Topics in Computer Vision](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~ahowens/eecs542/w24/). They include diffusion model, transformer, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF).

1. [UNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597): backbone of the Stable Diffusion model.
2. [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762): fundamental of all Generative Models.
3. [Vit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929): transformer in vision.
4. [MAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06377): masked autoencoders in vision, similar to BERT in NLP.
5. [Stable Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752): combines diffuion, transformer, and UNet.
6. [bark](https://github.com/suno-ai/bark): Suno's transformer-based text-to-audio model.
